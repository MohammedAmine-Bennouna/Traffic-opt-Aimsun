# Traffic-opt-Aimsun
Implemented a simulation-based optimization algorithm that optimizes traffic flow by adjusting traffic control devices.
Combined approaches based on meta-models, queuing models and Aimsun traffic simulations.

This work was completled with 6 other polytechnique students.
Our work is mostly inspired by the following article: Carolina Osorio, Michel Bierlaire (2013) A Simulation-Based Optimization Frame-
work for Urban Transportation Problems. Operations Research 61(6) :1333-1345.
